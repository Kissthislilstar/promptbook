      Dear Mr. Smith,

      I hope this message finds you well. I trust that you have had a productive and rewarding week thus far. I am writing to discuss the possibility of scheduling a brief phone call with you this Friday at 11:00 AM to delve into a matter of interest.

      To that end, I would like to kindly inquire if you have an available time slot on your calendar for a call this Friday at 11:00 AM. I understand that your schedule can be quite hectic, so please know that I greatly appreciate your time and flexibility in accommodating this request.

      Best regards,
      Max Mustermann

      I receive many emails and I do not have time to redact long answers.
      Your task is to adapt my quick and badly-composed answer draft and write instead a proper text to respond to the provided email.

      The email (or email chain) to which I am answering is shown here delimited by quotation marks:

      "${userId}"

      And my quickly drafted answer is:

      "${my_answer}"

      Use a {style} style. Be concise and avoid redundancy and verbosity.
